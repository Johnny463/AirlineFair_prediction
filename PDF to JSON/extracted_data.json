Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of abscess bacterial.\nAdditional information: Patient received second dose on 23Jun2022 and noticed little dots on thighs on 24Jun2022. It got worse over\nthe weekend. Large rashes are seen on first two injection sites and a smaller rash on the last one. Patient stated that her psoriasis is\n'beautiful' she's not had skin like this at her breast/armpit area in over 20 years. Smooth, brown/healing, no signs of redness. As\npreviously known, she has a secondary diagnosis of HS. She unfortunately also reports two new abscesses, one in intergluteal fold\nD\n(described as big and hard) and one on her left buttock (scabbed).

Those\nappeared this weekend, 3-4 days after her second Abrilada dose on 22Jun2022.

MD was\nconcerned about the on-going Hidradenitis Suppurativa abscesses that are forming. She wanted to re-induce patient at a Hidradenitis\nSuppurativa dose level and then HS dose maintenance (off label use) but keeping primary diagnosis as Plaque Psoriasis.
