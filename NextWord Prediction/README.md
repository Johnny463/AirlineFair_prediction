## Description

The Airline Fare Prediction project utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict airline fares for different flight itineraries. The application is developed in Python and provides a user-friendly API for fare prediction.

## Features

- Data Preprocessing: The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values and outliers, ensuring accurate predictions.
- Machine Learning Model: The core of the application is a machine learning model trained on historical flight data.
- Deployment: The API is deployed on Postman, making it accessible for users to get fare predictions for their flight details.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>



Replace the placeholders (`<airline_name>`, `<departure_time>`, `<arrival_time>`, `<duration>`, `<source_place>`, `<destination_place>`, `<total_stops>`, and `<date>`) with the appropriate values for your prediction.

For example:


## Parameters

Here are the parameters you can use with the `predict.py` script:

- `airline`: The name of the airline (e.g., "Air India", "IndiGo", "Jet Airways", etc.).
- `departure`: The departure time of the flight in the format "HH:MM".
- `arrival`: The arrival time of the flight in the format "HH:MM".
- `duration`: The duration of the flight in hours and minutes (e.g., "6h 30m").
- `source`: The departure place or city (e.g., "Delhi", "Mumbai", etc.).
- `destination`: The arrival place or city (e.g., "Delhi", "Mumbai", etc.).
- `stops`: The number of stops on the flight (e.g., "non-stop", "1 stop", "2 stops", etc.).
- `date`: The date of the flight in the format "YYYY-MM-DD".

Feel free to customize the parameter descriptions based on the specific needs of your project.


In this example, we added a section called "Parameters" in the README file, where we list the parameters that can be used with the `predict.py` script. We used angle brackets (`< >`) to denote placeholders for the parameter values and provided descriptions for each parameter. Users of your project can then replace the placeholders with actual values when running the prediction.

Remember to replace `your-username` and `your-repo` with your GitHub username and repository name, respectively. Additionally, adjust the filenames (`predict.py` or any other relevant file) and command line arguments based on your project's structure.
